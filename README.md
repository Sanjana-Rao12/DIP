# Digital Image Procesisng 
EDS6397 - Digital Image Processing - Group 9 - Weather Prediction Using images dataset

## Run the model:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the dataset from the folder 

## Introduction
This project leverages image datasets and advanced machine learning techniques to predict weather conditions. By analyzing visual cues from images, such as cloud patterns, lighting, and other features, the system predicts weather categories with high accuracy. 

### Technologies Used:
1. Python: Core programming language
2. TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework
3. OpenCV: Image preprocessing
4. Matplotlib: Data visualization

## Flask application
